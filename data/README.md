Housing Pipeline Dataset
========================

This directory contains the housing pipeline dataset downloaded from [The SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/data?dept=Planning&type=datasets&search=pipeline)
* [cleaned](cleaned) - canonical JSON housing data used for analysis
* [raw](raw) - raw datasets in csv format
* [raw/columnnames](raw) - transform file to map raw csv columns to a standard set
* [cleaner.py](cleaner.py) - transform to clean the raw data

Files are marked as belonging to a certain quarter, but that file can contain events from previous quarters.

It is unclear what the relationship between the quarter of the file and date of the events it contains is.

Data Model
----------

Each row represents a _transition_ into another stage of the pipeline for a single project.

This means the same project can occur multiple times in the dataset, since multiple transitions are required before a project is complete.

Below are the 7 states that a project can be in:

### Project States

| PROJECT STATUS     | Current pipeline status of a project application.                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Under Construction | Project is under construction.                                                  |
| BP Approved        | DBI approved building permit.                                                   |
| BP Issued          | Project sponsor has picked up approved building permit (proxy measure of under construction). |
| BP Reinstated      | DBI reinstates a lapsed building permit (lapses after 1 year with no activity). |
| BP Filed           | Application for building permit filed with BPI                                  |
| PL Approved        | All Planning actions approved.                                                  |
| PL Filed           | Project application filed with the Planning Department                          |

### Distribution of APN Appearances

Over all quarters listed on main README.md, we count 2383 unique APNs.

The distribution of APNs by how many times they appear in the dataset is:

| Number of APN Occurances | Number of APNs that Occured That Many Times |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 289 |
| 2  | 329 |
| 3  | 203 |
| 4  | 154 |
| 5  | 204 |
| 6  | 210 |
| 7  | 158 |
| 8  | 115 |
| 9  | 134 |
| 10 | 87  |
| 11 | 69  |
| 12 | 78  |
| 13 | 75  |
| 14 | 101 |
| 15 | 75  |
| 16 | 98  |
| 17 | 2   |
| 18 | 1   |
| 27 | 1   |

Glossary
--------

`APN`: Assessor Parcel Number (blocklot, blklot)
`BEST_STATE`: The state of the project at the time the record was submitted. Must be one of the values from the above `Project States` table
`BEST_DATE`: The date the record was submitted, which means the date at which the project entered its current project state.
`Entitlement Status`: 0 = Under Planning Review, -1 = Approved By Planning
`MIPS`: Managerial, Information, Professional Services. (Same as Office?)
`CIE`: Cultural, Institutional, Educational
`PDR`: Production, Distribution, Repair


Other Notes
-----------

The Pipeline Report measures housing production in terms of housing units. Non-residential development, on the other hand, is measured in terms of building square footage.

Columns concerning number of units may be blank for non-residential development, and vice versa.


Data Issues

### Duplicate Records

There seem to be some duplicate records in the dataset,

For example, these two records have the same `APN`, `BEST_STATE`, and `BEST_DATE`, however the address is slightly different.
