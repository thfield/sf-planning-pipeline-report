## About
This is a project of the [Data Science Working Group](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg) at Code for San Francisco

[The original ask](https://github.com/sfbrigade/make-with-open-data/blob/master/quarterly-planning-reports.md), or how this project got started.

[Here is a past report that's a great overview of the how the data has been used in the past](http://sf-planning.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/9338-pipelinereport_q3_2014.pdf)  

[Paula Chiu](mailto:paula.chiu@sfgov.org) is our contact as SF Gov (she's part of our Slack group too)

These DSWG members are contributors to this project, and how to get in touch with us on [slack](http://c4a.me/cfsfslack):

## Working Plan/Current Priorities

1. Create a data model that can span several quarters, adjusting for the name mismatch (@jfquinn, @arashaghevli)
2. Come up with detailed UI design (@caressalc27, @alwynalau)
3. Analyze how long projects take for completion. Determine what relationship between project size and completion time is. (@juancarlos)

## Questions we want to answer

The main question(s) we want to tackle with an interactive visualization would be the following. 
- How long it takes a project to go from start to end.
    - Does it depend on neighborhood? Size of project?
    - What factors depend on this?
    - What status of the projects take longer
    - Is there a status of the project where it's common for projects to get cancelled?
- At some point in time in the lifecycle of a project, the # of units are defined? This number changes towards the end (usually decreases).Typically speaking how many units do we lose over the course of a project?
    - What factors tend to lead to this?
- How many projects are being built per neighborhood?
    
Keep in mind we want to look at this at the Neighborhood and Zoning district level not at a individual project level.

Other Questions (From previous meeting):
  - How many units are being built per neighborhood per time period?
      - how many of those are affordable?
  - How many projects are being built per neighbood
  - How much space designated as "light industrial" is being gained/lost per neighboorhood?
  - Projects approved and filed over time:
      - what happens to the planning process per neighborhood
      - when were projects filed/approved/started/completed?
  - Size of project vs speed of getting on market?
  - A way to gauge compliance with Nov 2016's Measure X


## How do I access the data?

See data/README.md for information about analyzing the data. The data is checked into the repository under `data/cleaned`, and you should not need to download it yourself for most purposes.
