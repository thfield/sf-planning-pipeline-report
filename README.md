## About
This is a project of the [Data Science Working Group](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg) at Code for San Francisco

[The original ask](https://github.com/sfbrigade/make-with-open-data/blob/master/quarterly-planning-reports.md), or how this project got started.

[Here is a past report that's a great overview of the how the data has been used in the past](http://sf-planning.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/9338-pipelinereport_q3_2014.pdf)  

[Paula Chiu](mailto:paula.chiu@sfgov.org) is our contact as SF Gov (she's part of our Slack group too)

## Working Plan/Next
1. Create a data model that can span several quarters, adjusting for the name mismatch
2. Draw data from the Socrata API dynamically
3. Come up with detailed UI design
4. Questions to explore:
The main question(s) we want to tackle with an interactive visualization would be the following. 
- How long it takes a project to go from start to end.
    - Does it depend on neighborhood? Size of project?
    - What factors depend on this?
    - What status of the projects take longer
    - Is there a status of the project where it's common for projects to get cancelled?
- At some point in time in the lifecycle of a project, the # of units are defined? This number changes towards the end (usually decreases).Typically speaking how many units do we lose over the course of a project?
    - What factors tend to lead to this?
- How many projects are being built per neighborhood?
    
Keep in mind we want to look at this at the Neighborhood and Zoning district level not at a individual project level.

Other Questions (From previous meeting):
  - How many units are being built per neighborhood per time period?
      - how many of those are affordable?
  - How many projects are being built per neighbood
  - How much space designated as "light industrial" is being gained/lost per neighboorhood?
  - Projects approved and filed over time:
      - what happens to the planning process per neighborhood
      - when were projects filed/approved/started/completed?
  - Size of project vs speed of getting on market?
  - A way to gauge compliance with Nov 2016's Measure X
